   git clone https://github.com/RynnKunnn/Rynn-UI.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Rynn-UI
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
4. Modify the `settings.json` file to configure your API documentation.
5. Start the server:

   npm start
   ```
Your API documentation should now be available at `http://localhost:<PORT>`.

## Customization

![Layout](https://files.catbox.moe/bjazqb.png)

You can easily customize the UI by editing the `settings.json` file. Below is a breakdown of the configurable fields:

### General Settings

- `name`: Sets the name of your API (e.g., "Rynn Api's").
- `version`: Specifies the version of your API interface (e.g., "Rynn UI").
- `description`: A brief description of your API documentation.

### Header Customization

- `status`: Indicates the current status of your API (e.g., "Online!").
- `imageSrc`: An array of image URLs to display in the header. Multiple images can be set for variety.
- `imageSize`: Defines responsive image sizes based on the device type:
  - `mobile`: Size for mobile devices (e.g., "80%").
  - `tablet`: Size for tablets (e.g., "40%").
  - `desktop`: Size for desktops (e.g., "40%").

### Api Settings

- `creator`: Displays the creator's name in the interface.

### Links

- `name`: Label for the link (e.g., "Source Code").
- `url`: The URL to the resource.

### Categories and Apis

Organize APIs into categories for better navigation:
- **Category Name (e.g., "AI (Artificial Intelligence)")**
  - `items`: Define individual APIs within the category.
    - `name`: The name of the API (e.g., "LuminAI").
    - `desc`: A short description of the API (e.g., "Talk with luminai").
    - `path`: The endpoint path for the API (e.g., /ai/luminai?text=).

### Example `settings.json`

Here’s an example of how your settings.json file might look:
```json

          "desc": "Talk with luminai",
          "path": "/ai/luminai?text="
        },
        {
          "name": "HydroMind",
          "desc": "Talk with hydromind",
          "path": "/ai/hydromind?text=&model=",
          "innerDesc": "See the list of supported AI models here: https://mind.hydrooo.web.id"
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "name": "Random",
      "items": [
        {
          "name": "Blue Archive",
          "desc": "Blue Archive Random Images",
          "path": "/random/ba"
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "name": "Search Tools",
      "items": [
        {
          "name": "YouTube",
          "desc": "Video search",
          "path": "/search/youtube?q="
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```
This structure allows you to easily adapt and configure the interface to suit your API needs!
